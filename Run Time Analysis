All three data structures have their advantages and disadvantages. Hash table allows you to be able to change things around and delete ones that are not needed. This data structure would not be as fast as the other two we are talking about. Tree data structure can be more effective based on the dual storage system of having the left and the right. This would have the same disadvantage as hash tables because they would run slower than normal. The vector would be the simplest of the three and would not require much memory or take much time at all to access. The main disadvantage of this data structure is that you would not be able to modify the structure once it is created. 

	If I were to make a recommendation for which data structure to use in this code, it would be Hash Tables. Hash tables would run slower than most but would be very beneficial to this sort of code in sorting different courses. This would give you the flexibility to change the items of the project or different parameters. Vector would not be a good choice because once the data structure is created, you would not be able to modify it further.
